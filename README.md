## Project Description

**Smart Mouwatin** is a simple and citizen-focused platform that helps **Moroccan citizens** easily access the administrative information they need.

###  Problem Statement

Many citizens struggle because they don’t know:

- Lists the **required documents** for each procedure in a simple way.
- Shows **where to go** based on the user’s **current location**.
- Lets users **ask questions by voice or text**, even if they cannot read or write.
- Works on both **desktop** and **mobile**.
